# Beat Link & Beat Link Trigger + OPUS-QUAD Support

These tables represent the absolute latest state of the project, including the latest findings of interfacing with the OPUS-QUAD.

## "Modes" Envision / High Level Methods

I envision beat-link (or maybe just Beat Link Trigger) can operate in two modes with the OPUS-QUAD. This can be thought of sort of the two high level "modes" of interfacing with the OPUS-QUAD.

| Mode                  | Pre-requisites                                                                                                | Stable Metadata Matching | Number of Metadata Archives Supported Simultaneouslyâ€ â€  | Precise time sync, beat triggers, & phase-synced Ableton Link | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. rekordbox lighting | OPUS-QUAD is connected to the same network, and metadata archive is attached                                  | âœ“                        | 3                                                      | âœ•                                                             | Most stable mode at the moment, phrase triggers work well in my experience, and timecode interpolation is okay-ish. However note, beat triggers nor Ableton Link phase-syncing is not supported, since beat packets are not sent back. |
| 2. VirtualCDJ         | OPUS-QUAD is connected to the same network, **database passphrase is set**, then metadata archive is attached | âœ“                        | 1\*                                                    | âœ“                                                             | Newest mode due to the recent findings of absolute position packets being sent back, by sending VirtualCDJ keep alive packets. However, this needs work.                                                                               |

\* at the moment. If matching via ID + track duration works out, we can support all 3 archives simultaneously.

â€ â€  It does not matter where the USB is attached on the OPUS-QUAD, its just the amount of metadata archives supported at once, or in other words, the amount of USB slots connected to the OPUS-QUAD that can be supported simultaneously.

## Lower Level Methods

Next, here is a table showing the lower level methods of interfacing with the OPUS-QUAD, with the current beat-link code.

Each method assumes there is a metadata archive attached. Note that every method requires a metadata archive to be attached, as the OPUS-QUAD has no way to interface with the rekordbox databases connected to the USB slots. Additionally for context, the USB slot number (the USB number the USB stick is plugged into) is not sent back from the OPUS-QUAD, or has not been found yet. So we have to use workarounds to detect the USB slot number.

Legend:

- ðŸŸ¢ = Full support
- ðŸŸ£ = Planned for full support
- ðŸ”´ = No support
- "Key" = database passphrase is set
- "lRekordbox" = rekordbox lighting keep alive packet is being sent
- "VirtualCDJ" = VirtualCDJ(?)--the one dysentery sends--keep alive packet is being sent

The table below is sorted by the best to the worst method in terms of beat-link and Beat Link Trigger support.

| Method                                  | Precise time sync | Phase-synced Ableton Link/Beat triggers support | Metadata matching with metadata archive | USB Slot Number Detection (which makes support for multiple metadata archives possible) | Mode this method is used in |

\* Same reason as in the "Modes Envision" section.

â€  James will implement the virtual beat packets, since the OPUS-QUAD doesn't send any beat packets at all in any methods. The virtual beat packets will be simulated by using the precise time sync.
